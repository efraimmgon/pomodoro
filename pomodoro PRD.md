# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Simple CLI Pomodoro Program

## 1. **Overview**
The goal of this project is to create a simple, functional, and user-friendly Pomodoro timer program that runs in the command-line interface (CLI). The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. This program will help users manage their time effectively and stay productive.

---

## 2. **Objectives**
- Provide a simple and intuitive CLI-based Pomodoro timer.
- Allow users to start, pause, and reset the timer.
- Notify users when a work session or break session ends.
- Track the number of completed Pomodoro sessions.
- Be lightweight.

---

## 3. **Features**

### 3.1 Core Features
1. **Timer Functionality**
   - Work interval: 25 minutes (configurable).
   - Short break: 5 minutes (configurable).
   - Long break: 15 minutes after 4 completed work intervals (configurable).
   - Countdown timer displayed in the CLI.

2. **Session Tracking**
   - Track the number of completed Pomodoro sessions.
   - Automatically switch between work and break sessions.

3. **Notifications**
   - Play a sound or display a message when a session ends.
   - Notify the user whether it's time to work or take a break.

4. **Controls**
   - Start the timer.
   - Pause/resume the timer.
   - Reset the timer to the beginning of the current session.
   - Exit the program.

### 3.2 Optional Features (Future Enhancements)
- Customizable work/break durations via command-line arguments.
- Log completed sessions to a file for tracking productivity.
- Visual progress bar or ASCII art to represent the timer.
- Support for system notifications (e.g., desktop notifications).

---

## 4. **User Interaction**

### 4.1 Command-Line Interface
The program will be launched from the terminal with the following commands:
- `pomodoro start`: Start the Pomodoro timer.
- `pomodoro pause`: Pause the timer.
- `pomodoro resume`: Resume the timer.
- `pomodoro reset`: Reset the current session.
- `pomodoro exit`: Exit the program.

### 4.2 Timer Display
The timer will display in the following format:
```
[Work Session] 25:00
Press 'p' to pause, 'r' to reset, 'q' to quit.
```

## 5. **Technical Requirements**

### 5.1 Programming Language
- Ruby (recommended for simplicity and cross-platform compatibility).

---

## 6. **User Stories**
1. As a user, I want to start a 25-minute work session so that I can focus on my task.
2. As a user, I want to be notified when the work session ends so that I can take a break.
3. As a user, I want to pause and resume the timer so that I can handle interruptions.
4. As a user, I want to reset the timer so that I can start over if needed.
5. As a user, I want to see how many Pomodoro sessions Iâ€™ve completed so that I can track my productivity.

---

## 7. **Milestones**
1. **Week 1**: Set up the project, implement basic timer functionality.
2. **Week 2**: Add session tracking and notifications.
3. **Week 3**: Implement pause/resume and reset functionality.
4. **Week 4**: Test and refine the program, add documentation.

---

## 8. **Success Metrics**
- The program runs without errors on all major platforms.
- Users can complete at least 4 Pomodoro sessions without issues.
- Positive feedback from users on ease of use and functionality.

---

## 9. **Risks and Mitigation**
- **Risk**: Users may find the CLI interface too basic.
  - **Mitigation**: Add optional features like progress bars or system notifications.

---

## 10. **Out of Scope**
- Graphical user interface (GUI).
- Integration with third-party productivity tools.
- Advanced analytics or reporting.
